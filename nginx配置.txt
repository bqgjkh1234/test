Pre-Built Packages for Stable version
To set up the yum repository for RHEL/CentOS, create the file named /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo with the following contents:

[nginx]
name=nginx repo
baseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/OS/OSRELEASE/$basearch/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
Replace ¡°OS¡± with ¡°rhel¡± or ¡°centos¡±, depending on the distribution used, and ¡°OSRELEASE¡± with ¡°6¡± or ¡°7¡±, for 6.x or 7.x versions, respectively.

For Debian/Ubuntu, in order to authenticate the nginx repository signature and to eliminate warnings about missing PGP key during installation of the nginx package, it is necessary to add the key used to sign the nginx packages and repository to the apt program keyring. Please download this key from our web site, and add it to the apt program keyring with the following command:

sudo apt-key add nginx_signing.key
For Debian replace codename with Debian distribution codename, and append the following to the end of the /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ codename nginx
deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/debian/ codename nginx
For Ubuntu replace codename with Ubuntu distribution codename, and append the following to the end of the /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ codename nginx
deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ codename nginx
For Debian/Ubuntu then run the following commands:

apt-get update
apt-get install nginx
For SLES run the following command:

zypper addrepo -G -t yum -c 'http://nginx.org/packages/sles/12' nginx
Pre-Built Packages for Mainline version
To set up the yum repository for RHEL/CentOS, create the file named /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo with the following contents:

[nginx]
name=nginx repo
baseurl=http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/OS/OSRELEASE/$basearch/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
Replace ¡°OS¡± with ¡°rhel¡± or ¡°centos¡±, depending on the distribution used, and ¡°OSRELEASE¡± with ¡°6¡± or ¡°7¡±, for 6.x or 7.x versions, respectively.

For Debian/Ubuntu, in order to authenticate the nginx repository signature and to eliminate warnings about missing PGP key during installation of the nginx package, it is necessary to add the key used to sign the nginx packages and repository to the apt program keyring. Please download this key from our web site, and add it to the apt program keyring with the following command:

deb http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/debian/ codename nginx
deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/debian/ codename nginx
For Ubuntu replace codename with Ubuntu distribution codename, and append the following to the end of the /etc/apt/sources.list file:

deb http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/ubuntu/ codename nginx
deb-src http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/ubuntu/ codename nginx
For Debian/Ubuntu then run the following commands:

apt-get update
apt-get install nginx
For SLES run the following command:

zypper addrepo -G -t yum -c 'http://nginx.org/packages/mainline/sles/12' nginx
Source Packages
Packaging sources can be found in the packaging sources repository.

The default branch holds packaging sources for the current mainline version, while stable-* branches contain latest sources for stable releases. To build binary packages, run make in debian/ directory on Debian/Ubuntu, or in rpm/SPECS/ on RHEL/CentOS/SLES.

Packaging sources are distributed under the same 2-clause BSD-like license used by nginx.

Dynamic Modules
Main nginx package is built with all modules that do not require additional libraries to avoid extra dependencies. Since version 1.9.11, nginx supports dynamic modules and the following modules are built as dynamic and shipped as separate packages:

nginx-module-geoip
nginx-module-image-filter
nginx-module-njs
nginx-module-perl
nginx-module-xslt
Signatures
Both RPM packages and Debian/Ubuntu repositories use digital signatures to verify the integrity and origin of the downloaded package. In order to check a signature it is necessary to download nginx signing key and import it to the rpm or apt program¡¯s keyring:

On Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt-key add nginx_signing.key
On RHEL/CentOS:
sudo rpm --import nginx_signing.key
On SLES:
sudo rpm --import nginx_signing.key
On Debian/Ubuntu/SLES signatures are checked by default, but on RHEL/CentOS it is necessary to set

gpgcheck=1
in the /etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo file.

Since our PGP keys and packages are located on the same server, they are equally trusted. It is highly advised to additionally verify the authenticity of the downloaded PGP key. PGP has the ¡°Web of Trust¡± concept, when a key is signed by someone else¡¯s key, that in turn is signed by another key and so on. It often makes possible to build a chain from an arbitrary key to someone¡¯s key who you know and trust personally, thus verify the authenticity of the first key in a chain. This concept is described in details in GPG Mini Howto. Our keys have enough signatures, and their authenticity is relatively easy to check.
